//        A number is perfect if it is equal to the sum of all its positive
//        divisors not including the number itself. For example, the number
//    6 is perfect because it has divisors 1, 2, 3 and 6, but 6 is not counted
//        as a divisor to check if it is perfect. If we add 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
