//        We want to stack a certain number of tin cans in the shape of a pyramid so
//        that at the top there is only one can, in the row above there will be two cans,
//        in the row below there will be 3 cans and so on. Make a program that reads
//        the number of cans we have and says whether it is possible to stack them in
//        this way or not.
//        For example, 6 cans would be stackable (1+2+3), 10 cans would be
//        stackable (1+2+3+4), 9 cans would not be possible.
