//        EXERCISE 16A
//        We have an ice-cream parlour management system that we have to program,
//        where the user enters the money he has and the system informs
//        him of the ice cream he can afford. We have of the following ice creams:
//      􀁸 Water ice cream 60 cents.
//      􀁸 Cream ice cream 1 euro.
//      􀁸 Ice cream with toppings 1,6 euros.
//      􀁸 Ice cream with nutella 1,8 euros.
//      􀁸 Two scoops of ice cream on a wafer 2 euros.
//      􀁸 Mini ice cream cake 2,5 euros.
//
//        Make different versions of the programme:
//      􀀹 Show the most expensive ice cream you can afford (maybe none of them).
//      􀀹 Show the cheapest ice cream you can afford (maybe none of them).
//      􀀹 Show which of the available ice creams you can afford (maybe none of them)
