//        EXERCISE 1P Make a program that, given a year, tells us whether
//        it is a leap year or not. A year is a leap year under the following
//        conditions:  The year entered must be after 1582, the year in which the
//        Gregorian calendar we use today was established.  A year divisible
//        by 4 is a leap year if it is not divisible by 100.  If a year is
//        divisible by 100 and is also divisible by 400, it is also a leap
//        year.
