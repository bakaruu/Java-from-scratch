//        EXERCISE 10R
//        Calculate the net payroll of some workers whose work is paid in hours.
//        The calculation is carried out as follows
//        The calculation is made as follows:
//        ï‚· The first 35 hours at a flat rate of â‚¬10.
//        ï‚· Hours after 35 hours are paid at 15.
//        ï‚· The taxes to be deducted from the workers vary, depending on
//        whether the salary is less than 600 the salary is tax free
//        and if the opposite is the case a 20% tax will be charged.
