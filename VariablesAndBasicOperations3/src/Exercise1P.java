//        EXERCISE 1P
//        Two trains depart from different cities (we know the distance between the
//        2 cities) in the same direction, but in opposite directions. Make a program that
//        calculates the point of collision of both locomotives knowing the speed
//        (we assume constant) of each of them. You must calculate and display
//        d1 and d2. Then make use of the following formulas:


        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int distance2Cities = 12;
        int train1Speed = 60;
        int train2Speed = 83;

//        Time of encounter (or collision time) formula t = D/v1+v2
//        Equation of Uniform Rectilinear Motion(URM) e = v * t
